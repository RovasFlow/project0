      <h1>League of Legends Drafting</h1>
    <p>
      Many players in League of Legends know of the three points in the game. Early game, mid-game, and late game; however, there is one more that is overlooked by many. The draft phase in League of Legends can be argued to be even harder than the actual game itself. With 6.6291186147868E42 different drafts that are possible in League of Legends, as of 4/15/2020, the draft phase can determine whether a team can win or lose before the game even happens itself.
