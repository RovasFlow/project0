        <p>There are 8 core parts during draft phase. Red side ban 1, Blue side ban 1, Blue/Red side pick 1, Blue/Red side ban 2, Blue/Red pick 2. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Blue Side Ban 1
            <p>These bans are used to empower Blue side first pick. Let's say Blue side wants to pick Zoe on B1. Thne Blue side should consider banning Syndra, Yasuo, Panth, etc. because they can hinder what Zoe does either in lane or out of lane while also being flexible in multiple roles. </p>
          <li>Red Side Ban 1
            <p>This is the side where you ban champions that are either high priority (ex. Morde season 5), or champs that hides intention (ex. flex picks (ex.Akali/Irelia season 8), champions that can play more than two modes (ex. Not Renekton, Not Lee, Not Elise, Not Reksai, Not Olaf, Not NA Jayce (Only mode is disappointment), Not Qiyana, etc.). The only exception to picking champions that does not hide intention is when they are high priority).</p>
          <li>Blue Side Pick 1
            <h3>B1</h3>
            <p>For example, patch 10.4 say Red side bans Ornn, Gangplank, and Gragas. Blue side has the option to pick Syndra, Zoe, Noctourne, Zilean, Senna, etc. Now all Blue side needs to do is pick one from the list and use the three bans to take away champions that can annoy B1. Syndra has no counters that does not hinder Red sides team compositions. If Red side responds with Leblanc it's now a coinflip between skills in the mid lane; however, Red now runs into the issue of picking another pick that goes with Leblanc such as Lee/J4/Leona/Naut/etc. Basically champions that want to go in and fight. Blue side can now respond with two picks that now matches with Syndra's playstyle and denies the aggressiveness of Red side with Ezreal/Xayah and Rakan/Varus/Zyra/etc. Or just put Syndra bot and now match Leblanc against another pick somwhere during Blue side pick 2 like Lissandra/Zilean/Kass/Galio/etc. as long as they fit within the jurisdiction of Syndra whilst also denying Red side from either making Leblanc do nothing or Red side is forced to play an unfavorable team composition against Blue side.</p>
