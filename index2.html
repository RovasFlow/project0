          <li> Blue Side Map
            <p> In return for having a more vulnerable bot lane and weaker dragon control, blue side has terrain advantage of baron and a safer top side.
            </p>
          <li> Red Side Map
            <p> Similarly Red side has the advantages of a safer bot lane and terrain advantage of dragon sacrifacing baron terrain and a more vulnerable top lane.
        </ul>
      <p>Using <a href = https://map.riftkit.net/> rift kit</a>, down below are the general gank paths that can happen.</p>
        <p>The color yellow and green indicates <span style="color:blue;">Blue sides</span> gank pathing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Yellow 1~5 are generel gank paths.
        <li> Green 1~2 are where general dives are set up.
      </ul>
    <p>The color red and blue indicates <span style="color:red;">Red sides</span> gank pathing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Red 1~5 are general gank paths.
        <li>Blue 1~2 are where general dives are set up.
      </ul>
        <img src="Red Lane Adv.jpg" width="33%"> <p>Red side top and Blue side bot must be wary of the same issues of the tribush opening when considering where the opposing ganker can show from. In contrast Blue side top and Red side bot only need to worry about river and lane ganks. This means more room to place vision elsewhere and more freedom to push up with less stress as compared to their respective lane opponents.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>The terrain advantages for both Blue and Red side are also crucial when it comes to objective. The image below is each sides control over dragon pit.</p>
        <img src= "Blue Side Control.jpg" width="66%">
        <p> The white curves are the general openings where either Blue/Red sides team can go through, the red X's are the dangers that the respective team face, and the yellow line or cricle are the two most highly contested areas. The reason why this is an advantage to Red side is because of their entrances relative to dragons opening. The two entrances for Red side also act as an exit to which they can retreat to. Whereas Blue side entrances are farther spread apart because they mirror dragons opening. This is a massive issue for Blue side because if they start dragon first, their retreat is now towards bot lane while Red team dances around the two openings. If Blue team dedicate themselves to dragon then what happens is a pincer with dragon and Red team onto Blue team. </p>
        <p>The same concept follows Baron pit. Baron and Blue team act as a pincer onto Red team and Red teams retreat are path are restricted because of the concave of baron bit.</p>
